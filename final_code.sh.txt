#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
# #
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
#smb.conf (5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which
# are not shown in this example
#
#Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
# # When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
# differs from the default Samba behaviour
#
# - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#
# behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
# # enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic
# errors.

#### Networking ####
# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0
# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself. However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.

# Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
# values are "standalone server", "member server", "classic primary

# Running as "active directory domain controller" will require first
# running "samba-tool domain provision" to wipe databases and create a
# new domain.
